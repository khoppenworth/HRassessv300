# Quality and Compliance Framework

This project adopts a quality management approach inspired by internationally
recognised standards to ensure that engineering activities remain reliable,
secure, and maintainable.

## Governance and Life Cycle (ISO/IEC 12207 & ISO/IEC 90003)

- Maintain documented requirements, architecture decisions, and verification
  artefacts for each release.
- Track changes through version control with peer reviews before merging into
  mainline branches.
- Record configuration baselines for infrastructure, application settings, and
  dependencies.

## Product Quality (ISO/IEC 25010)

- Reliability: include automated smoke tests in the CI pipeline and ensure that
  database migrations are reversible.
- Maintainability: follow PSR-12 for PHP and use static analysis (PHPStan or
  Psalm) on every merge request.
- Security: conduct dependency scanning and review access controls every
  quarter.

## Information Security (ISO/IEC 27001 & 27002)

- Enforce least privilege for database credentials and rotate secrets at least
  every 90 days.
- Apply transport security (TLS), HTTP security headers, and continuous
  monitoring of failed logins.
- Perform annual risk assessments and update the Statement of Applicability to
  reflect implemented controls.

## Service Management (ISO/IEC 20000-1)

- Define service level objectives for availability and response times.
- Document incident response procedures, including communication templates and
  escalation matrices.
- Review post-incident action items within 10 business days of closure.

## Accessibility and Usability (ISO 9241 & ISO/IEC 40500)

- Ensure colour contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements.
- Provide keyboard navigable interfaces and descriptive alternative text for
  imagery.
- Perform usability evaluations with representative users each release cycle.

## Continuous Improvement (ISO 9001)

- Capture lessons learned after each iteration and feed them into a living
  improvement backlog.
- Measure process effectiveness via defect density, mean time to recovery, and
  customer satisfaction indices.
- Audit compliance quarterly and track corrective actions to closure.

## Documentation and Training (ISO/IEC 19770 & ISO/IEC 24748)

- Maintain an asset registry of deployed components, including licence and
  support details.
- Provide onboarding material covering architecture, secure coding guidelines,
  and operations runbooks.
- Review documentation every six months to keep procedures current.

## Verification Checklist

Use the following checklist prior to each release:

- [ ] Automated tests pass locally and in CI.
- [ ] Security headers and TLS configuration validated.
- [ ] Accessibility review completed.
- [ ] Backups verified and restoration drill performed within the last quarter.
- [ ] Compliance evidence stored in the project knowledge base.
