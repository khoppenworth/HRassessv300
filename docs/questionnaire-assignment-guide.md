# Questionnaire Assignment Workflow

The questionnaire assignment process now separates administrative setup from supervisor actions. Follow the steps below to configure and use the workflow.

## 1. Configure work functions (administrators)

1. Sign in as an administrator and open **Administration → System Data**.
2. Review the list of work functions. Update labels or active status as needed.
3. Use **Add Work Function** to create new entries. Keys should be lowercase letters, numbers, or underscores.
4. Confirm that every work function required by staff records exists and remains active.

## 2. Map questionnaires to work functions (administrators)

1. Go to **Administration → Manage Questionnaires**.
2. For each questionnaire, choose the work functions that should be allowed to use it. At least one work function must be selected before publishing.
3. Publish or update the questionnaire to persist the mapping.

## 3. Assign questionnaires to staff (supervisors)

1. Supervisors visit **Team & Reviews → Assign Questionnaires**.
2. Select a staff member. The page shows their current work function and available questionnaires.
3. Only questionnaires mapped to the staff member’s work function can be assigned.
4. Save the selection to notify the staff member and update their available assessments.

## Tips

- Staff members without a work function cannot receive questionnaires. Ask an administrator to update their profile first.
- Deactivating a work function immediately hides its questionnaires from supervisor assignment.
- The system automatically emails staff when supervisors change their assignments.
